This project aims to develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) model for detecting fake news and predicting the sentiment of tweets. The project will use two datasets of tweets that have been labeled with their authenticity and sentiment, respectively. The CNN model will be trained on these datasets using deep learning techniques, with the goal of applying it on different tweet dataset, in order to gain insights about current political events. The project will also utilize big data technologies, such as Tensorflow, to efficiently process and analyze the substantial amounts of data
